    <p>Pyrs are not a highly active breed. The breed was developed to be a livestock guardian and has been used since ancient times to protect flocks from wolves, bears, and human foes. When working, they will patrol their territory but tend to conserve their energy for fending off whatever may threaten their flock. Moderate exercise such as walks with their owner will help keep them healthy and happy. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine activities such as obedience trials and cart-pulling.</p>
