    <p>For all their abundant fur, Pyrs don’t require a lot of grooming, as their coat is dirt- and tangle-resistant. They have a double coat, with a long outer coat and a soft undercoat. They will shed this undercoat with great enthusiasm—“leading to a snowstorm,” one owner says. She laughs, “They shed in the spring, after whelping, in honor of certain Druid festivals, and after you enter them in a show!” A thorough brushing with a pin brush or slicker brush at least once a week will help to reduce the shed hair that ends up all over the house. The Pyr’s nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort. The teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.</p>
