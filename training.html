    <p>Pyrs were bred to be independent thinkers, to work without guidance watching and protecting their flock. Although they are intelligent, standard obedience training will be met with great indifference. They donâ€™t see the point of all that sitting, heeling, and staying. They will let their boredom show by performing any task you deem important with extremely slow responses. Nonetheless, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended to help give the Pyr a good start in becoming a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion.</p>
