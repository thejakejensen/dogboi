    <p>Ethical Pyr breeders have excelled in their commitment to health issues. The Great Pyrenees Club of America has stressed having all dogs tested for a variety of conditions that can affect the breed, including elbow and hip dysplasia, eye disorders, luxating patellas, and neurological and immune-mediated disorders. Some cancers occur in the breed, as well as bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach suddenly distends and sometimes twists. All Pyr owners should educate themselves to know the signs of bloat, and what to do should it happen.</p>
